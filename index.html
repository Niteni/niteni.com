                    cloud, and multi-tier architectures. Need an API product?

                        leads us to new ideas in photography. We created a

                        philosophy in an area we love. Find out how a chance

                        <p>Anticipating a happy event can be almost as
                        fun as the event itself. Share that excitement with
                        your friends and it can get positively giddy! Some
                        years ago, one of our team members made <a href="http://nabaday.com/">a site counting
                            down the days to his wife's birthday</a>. It became popular
                        with family and friends — some still engage after all
                        this time. We quickly realized there might be an
                        opportunity surrounding collective anticipation of
                        milestone events and special occasions.</p>

                        <p>We’re also parents of young children. If you have kids,
                        you've likely realized they don’t own clothes —
                        they rent them. Children’s clothes are ready to be passed
                        on, sometimes lightly worn or even unworn, and often
                        within months of their first wear. Getting rid of those
                        clothes and finding new ones can be time-consuming and
                        unrewarding. We’re working on lessening that pain with an
                        online consignment market for kids’ clothing.</p>
