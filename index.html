                        <h3>Software management</h3>
                        <p>We're enthusiastic collaborators on any project,
                        providing hands-on management of projects and teams.
                        We're experienced with Agile and Scrum methodologies,
                        with a history of working with remote teams and
                        clients. We help take complex projects from rough sketches to
                        finished products.</p>

                        <h3>Software development</h3>
                        <p>Our development team is versatile, and can meet the
                        needs of your product. No matter whether you're just
                        starting out, or have legacy code to maintain, we
                        deliver performant, scalable, and highly available
                        services. We've been doing test-driven development and
                        continuous integration before it was cool.</p>

                        <h3>Software architecture</h3>
                        <p>Our architects don't just issue designs from on
                        high, they dive into code, and are often testing ideas through
                        prototypes. No project too big or too small, we can handle
                        any scale, including enterprise, cloud, and multi-tier
                        architectures. Need an API product? We specialize in
                        service-oriented architecture (SOA) and RESTful micro-services
                        API design.</p>

                        <h3>Technical documentation</h3>
                        <p>Technical documentation is difficult to get right,
                        but we've got a handle on it. Our team has experience
                        documenting existing systems, as well as writing
                        developer guides. We can write your API or library
                        documentation, and translate your most technical
                        processes into English.</p>

                    <h3>Connoto</h3>
                    <p>We're avid photographers here at Niteni. Our passion
                    leads us to new ideas in photography. We created a
                    photography division, <a href="http://connoto.com">Connoto</a>, to test our product
                    philosophy in an area we love. We're currently working on problems in street photography and no-hassle camera backups.</p>

                    <h3>Consignment Kids' Clothing</h3>
                    <p>We’re also parents of young children. We’ve come to realize that children don’t own clothes — they rent them. Children’s clothes are passed on, sometimes unworn or lightly worn, often within months of their first wear. Getting rid of those clothes and finding new ones can be time-consuming. We’re working on lessening that pain with an online consignment market for kids’ clothing.</p>
