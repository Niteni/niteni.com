                    <p>We're enthusiastic collaborators on any project,
                    providing hands-on management of projects and teams.
                    We're experienced with Agile and Scrum methodologies,
                    with a history of working with remote teams and
                    clients. We help take complex projects from rough sketches to
                    finished products.</p>

                    <p>Our development team is versatile, and can meet the
                    needs of your product. Whether you're starting out, or have
                    legacy code to maintain, we can help. We
                    deliver performant, scalable, and highly available

                    <p>Our architects don't just issue designs from on
                    high, they dive into code, and are often testing ideas through
                    prototypes. No project is too big or too small. We can handle
                    any scale, including enterprise, cloud, and multi-tier
                    architectures. Need an API product? We specialize in
                    service-oriented architecture (SOA) and RESTful micro-services
                    API design.</p>

                    but we've got a handle on it. Our team has experience
                    documenting existing systems, as well as writing
                    developer guides. We can write your API or library
                    documentation, and translate your most technical
                    processes into plainest English.</p>

                    leads us to new ideas in photography. We created a
                    photography division, <a href="http://connoto.com">Connoto</a>, to test our product
                    philosophy in an area we love. We're currently working on problems in street photography and no-hassle camera backups.</p>

                    <h3>Consignment Kids' Clothing</h3>
                    <p>We’re also parents of young children. We’ve come to realize that children don’t own clothes — they rent them. Children’s clothes are passed on, sometimes unworn or lightly worn, often within months of their first wear. Getting rid of those clothes and finding new ones can be time-consuming. We’re working on lessening that pain with an online consignment market for kids’ clothing.</p>
